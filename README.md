# AR Delivery Application
An Augmented Reality app for android devices to show what drone delivery in a busy city centre might look like.

The app requires an android device compatible with ARCore, generally this requires a camera, accelerometer, and android version 7.0 or greater.
Full information can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices).

The app uses data produced by a drone network simulation model developed using [MAPS](https://github.com/CASCADE-MAPS/MAPS) as part of the [CASCADE](https://cascadeuav.com/) project.

Developed by Dr. Conor Marsh and Prof. Bill Crowther at The University of Manchester.
