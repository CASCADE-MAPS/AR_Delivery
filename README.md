# AR Delivery Application
An [Augmented Reality app](https://github.com/CASCADE-MAPS/AR_Delivery/blob/main/DroneDeliveryExample.apk) for android devices to show what drone delivery in a busy city centre might look like.

The app requires an android device compatible with ARCore, generally this requires a camera, accelerometer, and android version 7.0 or greater.
Full information regarding supported ARCore devices can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices).

The app uses data produced by a drone network simulation model developed using [MAPS](https://github.com/CASCADE-MAPS/MAPS) as part of the [CASCADE](https://cascadeuav.com/) project.

Developed by Dr. Conor Marsh and Prof. Bill Crowther at The University of Manchester. Draft paper available [here](https://github.com/CASCADE-MAPS/AR_Delivery/blob/main/Evaluation%20of%20XR%20Apps%20for%20Social%20Impact%20of%20Drone%20Delivery.pdf).
